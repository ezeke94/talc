# ðŸ”§ FINAL SETUP CHECKLIST - PWA Login Fix

## âœ… Firebase Console Configuration

### 1. Authorized Domains
**URL:** https://console.firebase.google.com/project/kpi-talc/authentication/settings

Navigate to: **Authentication â†’ Settings â†’ Authorized domains**

Add these domains:
- [ ] `localhost` (for local development)
- [ ] `kpitalc.netlify.app` (your production domain)
- [ ] `kpi-talc.firebaseapp.com` (Firebase hosting - already there)

**CRITICAL:** Without `kpitalc.netlify.app` in this list, OAuth redirect will fail with `auth/unauthorized-domain` error.

---

## âœ… Google Cloud Console - OAuth Configuration

### 2. OAuth 2.0 Client Redirect URIs
**URL:** https://console.cloud.google.com/apis/credentials

Steps:
1. Find your OAuth 2.0 Client ID (usually named "Web client (auto created by Google Service)")
2. Click Edit
3. Under "Authorized redirect URIs", add:
   - [ ] `https://kpi-talc.firebaseapp.com/__/auth/handler`
   - [ ] `https://kpitalc.netlify.app/__/auth/handler`
   - [ ] `http://localhost` (for local dev)

**CRITICAL:** The redirect URI MUST exactly match your deployed domain. Missing `https://kpitalc.netlify.app/__/auth/handler` will cause redirect to fail silently.

---

## âœ… Netlify Environment Variables

### 3. Set Environment Variables in Netlify
**URL:** https://app.netlify.com/sites/kpitalc/settings/deploys#environment

Navigate to: **Site settings â†’ Build & deploy â†’ Environment variables**

Add these variables:
```
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDdCtN1WsoNtMFAwEUDv34pJy4lT6a3I38
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=kpi-talc.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=kpi-talc
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=kpi-talc.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=67217863373
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:67217863373:web:d014a8576b8bd7cfdd6f84
VITE_FIREBASE_VAPID_KEY=[Get from Firebase Console â†’ Cloud Messaging]
```

**IMPORTANT:** After adding/changing environment variables, you MUST trigger a new deploy for them to take effect.

---

## âœ… Local Development Setup

### 4. Create .env File
Create a file named `.env` in the project root with:

```bash
VITE_FIREBASE_API_KEY=AIzaSyDdCtN1WsoNtMFAwEUDv34pJy4lT6a3I38
VITE_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=kpi-talc.firebaseapp.com
VITE_FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID=kpi-talc
VITE_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=kpi-talc.firebasestorage.app
VITE_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=67217863373
VITE_FIREBASE_APP_ID=1:67217863373:web:d014a8576b8bd7cfdd6f84
```

**NOTE:** `.env` is in `.gitignore` and should NOT be committed.

# Should open popup and login successfully
```

**Step 2: Test on Production (Browser Mode)**
```
1. Open https://kpitalc.netlify.app in browser
2. Click "Sign In with Google"

## âœ… Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "auth/unauthorized-domain"
**Solution:** 
- Add `kpitalc.netlify.app` to Firebase Console â†’ Authentication â†’ Authorized domains
- Wait 1-2 minutes for changes to propagate
- Clear browser cache and try again

### Issue: Redirect happens but no login
**Solution:**
- Verify `https://kpitalc.netlify.app/__/auth/handler` is in Google Cloud Console OAuth redirect URIs
- Check Network tab for /__/auth/handler request (should be 200, not cached)
- Clear service worker: DevTools â†’ Application â†’ Service Workers â†’ Unregister

### Issue: "Configuration object is invalid"
**Solution:**
- Environment variables not set in Netlify
- Redeploy after setting env vars
- Check build logs for VITE_FIREBASE_* references

### Issue: Works in browser but not in PWA
**Solution:**
- Third-party cookies must be enabled
- Check service worker isn't caching OAuth paths
- Verify PWA is actually in standalone mode (check console for "App is running in standalone mode")

## âœ… Verification Steps

After completing all setup:

1. **Check Firebase Console:**
   - [ ] Authorized domains includes `kpitalc.netlify.app`
   - [ ] Google sign-in method is enabled

2. **Check Google Cloud Console:**
   - [ ] OAuth redirect URIs includes `https://kpitalc.netlify.app/__/auth/handler`

3. **Check Netlify:**
   - [ ] All VITE_FIREBASE_* environment variables are set
   - [ ] Site has been redeployed after setting env vars

4. **Test Login:**
   - [ ] Works in browser mode on desktop
   - [ ] Works in installed PWA on Windows
   - [ ] Works in installed PWA on Android
   - [ ] Works in installed PWA on iOS

5. **Check Console Logs:**
   - [ ] "Firebase: IndexedDB persistence configured successfully"
   - [ ] "âœ“ Redirect sign-in successful: user@example.com"
   - [ ] "AuthStateChanged fired. User present? true"

---

## ðŸš€ Deploy to Production

```powershell
# Build locally to verify
npm run build

# Deploy to Netlify
netlify deploy --prod

# Or let Netlify auto-deploy on git push
git add .
git commit -m "Fix PWA login with proper auth configuration"
git push origin main
```

---

## ðŸ“ž If Still Not Working

Collect this information:
1. **Screenshot of Firebase Console â†’ Authorized domains**
2. **Screenshot of Google Cloud Console â†’ OAuth redirect URIs**
3. **Screenshot of Netlify â†’ Environment variables** (hide sensitive values)
4. **Browser console errors** when clicking login
5. **Network tab** showing /__/auth/handler request/response
6. **Platform tested:** Windows/Android/iOS + Browser/PWA mode

This will help identify the exact configuration issue.

---

## âœ¨ Success Indicators

When everything is working correctly:

**Browser Console:**
```
âœ“ Firebase Config: { authDomain: "kpi-talc.firebaseapp.com", ... }
âœ“ Firebase: IndexedDB persistence configured successfully
âœ“ Login: Starting sign-in process
âœ“ Login: Using redirect sign-in for standalone mode (PWA) 
   OR Login: Attempting popup sign-in (browser)
âœ“ Checking for redirect sign-in result...
âœ“ âœ“ Redirect sign-in successful: user@example.com
âœ“ AuthStateChanged fired. User present? true user@example.com
âœ“ Actual user to process: user@example.com
```

**User Experience:**
- Click "Sign In with Google" â†’ redirects/popup opens
- Select Google account
- Returns to app
- Dashboard loads with user profile visible
- No error messages
- Can navigate app normally
- Closing and reopening PWA keeps user logged in
