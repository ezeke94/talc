# Project Management System Implementation

## Overview
This implementation adds a comprehensive project management system to the TALC Management Application with two main views:

1. **Projects Dashboard** - Gantt chart view for timeline management
2. **Boards** - Kanban board view for workflow management

## Features Implemented

### 1. Project Management Core Features
- **Project Creation & Management**: Full CRUD operations for projects
- **Timeline Management**: Interactive Gantt chart with drag-and-drop timeline adjustments
- **Task Management**: Each project can contain multiple tasks with status tracking
- **Team Assignment**: Assign project owners and team members
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual progress indicators and completion percentages
- **Priority & Status Management**: Priority levels (High/Medium/Low) and status tracking
- **Dependencies**: Project dependency tracking
- **Reminders**: Configurable reminder notifications
- **Tags**: Flexible tagging system for project categorization

### 2. Gantt Chart View (Projects Page)
- **Interactive Timeline**: Drag and drop to adjust project timelines
- **Visual Progress**: Color-coded status indicators
- **Time Range Selection**: View projects over 30 days to 1 year
- **Project Details**: Click on any project for detailed information
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for mobile and tablet viewing

### 3. Kanban Board View (Boards Page)
- **Three Column Layout**: Planning → In Progress → Completed
- **Drag & Drop**: Move projects between stages with real-time updates
- **Task Visibility**: See tasks within each project card
- **Team Avatars**: Quick view of assigned team members
- **Overdue Indicators**: Visual warnings for overdue tasks
- **Progress Tracking**: Linear progress bars for each project

### 4. Permission System
- **Admin & Quality**: Full read/write access to all projects
- **Coordinator**: Read-only access to view projects and boards
- **Other Roles**: No access to project management features

### 5. Data Synchronization
- **Real-time Updates**: Both views sync from the same Firebase collection
- **Live Updates**: Changes reflect immediately across both views
- **Offline Support**: Leverages Firebase's offline capabilities

### File Structure
```

├── pages/
│   ├── Projects.jsx          # Gantt chart view
│   ├── Boards.jsx           # Kanban board view
│   └── SeedData.jsx         # Updated with project seeding
├── utils/

└── components/
    └── Layout.jsx           # Updated navigation
```

### Firebase Collections

#### Projects Collection Structure
```javascript
{
  id: "project_id",
  name: "Project Name",
  description: "Project Description",
  status: "Planning" | "In Progress" | "Completed" | "On Hold",
  priority: "High" | "Medium" | "Low",
  startDate: Timestamp,
  endDate: Timestamp,
  progress: 0-100,
  center: { id, name },
  owner: { userId, name, email, photoURL },
  assignedUsers: [{ userId, name, email, photoURL }],
  reminderDays: number,
  dependencies: [projectId],
  tags: ["tag1", "tag2"],
  tasks: [
    {
      id: "task_id",
      name: "Task Name",
      description: "Task Description",
      status: "Planning" | "In Progress" | "Completed",
      assignedTo: { userId, name, email },
      dueDate: Timestamp,
      completedDate?: Timestamp,
      priority: "High" | "Medium" | "Low"
    }
  ],
  createdAt: Timestamp,
  updatedAt: Timestamp,
  createdBy: { userId, name, email }
}
```

### Security Rules
Updated `firestore.rules` to include:
```javascript
match /projects/{projectId} {
  // Admin and Quality can read/write all projects
  allow read, write: if isAdmin() || isQuality();
  
  // Coordinators can only read projects
  allow read: if isCoordinator();
}
```

### Navigation Updates
- Added "Projects" to Dashboards dropdown menu (Admin/Quality only)
- Added "Boards" as standalone navigation item (after Calendar)
- Role-based visibility ensures proper access control

## Dependencies Added
```json
{
  "@dnd-kit/core": "^6.0.8",
  "@dnd-kit/sortable": "^7.0.2", 
  "@dnd-kit/utilities": "^3.2.1",
  "@mui/x-date-pickers": "^6.19.0",
  "date-fns": "^2.30.0"
}
```

## Mock Data Generation

### Sample Projects Include:
1. **Q1 Curriculum Implementation** - 65% complete, In Progress

3. **Mentor Performance Enhancement** - 100% complete, Completed
4. **Infrastructure Upgrade - Phase 2** - 5% complete, Planning
5. **Quality Assurance Framework** - 40% complete, In Progress

### Sample Data Features:
